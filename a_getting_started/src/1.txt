Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager.

creating a project with cargo:
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world

cargo also initializes a new git repo
you can override this behavior by using cargo new my_project --vcs=git

what cargo.toml is used for
Tells Cargo:
What your project is called
Which Rust edition to use
Which libraries to download
Cargo uses this file for:
cargo build
cargo run
cargo test
Dependency management

[package] → “About this project”

This section tells Cargo what your project is.
[dependencies] → “What my project needs to work”

This section tells Cargo which external crates (libraries) your project uses.

if we didnt create a project using cargo new xyz
then we can add cargo.toml using cargo init

We can create a project using cargo new.
We can build a project using cargo build.
We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.

When your project is finally ready for release, you can use cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in target/release instead of target/debug.
If you’re benchmarking your code’s running time, be sure to run cargo build --release and benchmark with the executable in target/release.
