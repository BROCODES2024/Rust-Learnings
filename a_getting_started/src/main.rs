fn main() {
// main function is the first code that runs in an executable rust program
println!("Hello, world!");
// In Rust, anything with `!` is a macro
// println! is a macro
// println does NOT exist
// but if we are still making a call to println then its a function

// how do we compile
//first cd the path of main.rs
//then do rustc main.rs and then do .\main.rs to get output
//Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager.
